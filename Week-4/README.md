# Welcome to Week 4

Welcome to Week 4 of our DSA Bootcamp 2025! By now, you've strengthened your grasp on fundamental topics like Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, and Recursion. This week, we move forward into more advanced and versatile tools that power efficient algorithms and problem-solving.

This week’s focus will be on **Stacks**, **Queues**, and **Dequeues** — essential linear data structures that serve as the foundation for parsing expressions, scheduling, and solving real-world problems like undo-redo, backtracking, and caching.

## Topics Covered

### Stacks
We’ll understand how stacks follow the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle and how they're used in problems like balancing symbols, reversing data, and evaluating expressions. You'll implement stacks using arrays, linked lists, and even explore Python’s `list` and `collections.deque`.

### Queues and Dequeues
Queues follow FIFO (First-In-First-Out), crucial for simulations, task scheduling, and more. You’ll explore basic queues, circular queues, and priority queues. We’ll also introduce **Dequeue (Double-Ended Queue)** which allows insertion and deletion from both ends — a powerful tool in sliding window problems and optimizations.

Throughout the week, you’ll solidify your concepts with curated problems that emphasize practical application, implementation challenges, and real interview-style scenarios.

> Don’t just learn how these structures work — understand where and why to use them. That’s what makes the difference in interviews and real-world applications.

Stay curious and consistent — and make sure to review previous weeks if anything feels fuzzy!

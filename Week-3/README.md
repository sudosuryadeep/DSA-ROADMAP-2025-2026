# Welcome to Week 3

Welcome to the third week of our DSA Bootcamp 2025! After practicing Linked Lists and Recursion in Week 2, we now move on to two highly practical and frequently used topics — **Sorting** and **Hashing**.

---

## Topics Covered

### Sorting Algorithms

We’ll cover key sorting techniques like:

- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort  

You’ll also understand where to use them, and how to compare their time complexities.

### Hashing

We’ll learn how hashing enables fast lookups and solves problems like:

- Counting frequency  
- Detecting duplicates  
- Finding subarrays  

We’ll also explore basic concepts of hash tables, hash functions, and handling collisions.

This week’s practice problems will help you strengthen your understanding and sharpen your implementation skills for both topics.

Keep coding, stay consistent, and take your time to debug and improve — you’re doing great!

# Welcome to Week 2

Welcome to the second week of our DSA Bootcamp 2025! After building a strong foundation with Time Complexity, Arrays, and Strings in Week 1, we’re now ready to dive deeper into more dynamic and powerful concepts.

This week, we’ll be exploring **Linked Lists** and **Recursion**, two core topics that are essential in both theoretical understanding and real-world applications of Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Topics Covered

### Linked Lists
We’ll learn how linked lists work under the hood — how nodes are connected via pointers, and how different variations like **singly**, **doubly**, and **circular** linked lists are implemented. Mastering operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal will sharpen your pointer and memory handling skills.

### Recursion
We’ll dive into the world of recursion — solving problems by breaking them into smaller, self-similar subproblems. Understanding the base case, recursive case, and stack behavior is crucial. We’ll also touch upon **memoization**, which forms the backbone of dynamic programming.

You’ll reinforce your understanding by working on handpicked LeetCode problems for both topics. These problems will help you develop pattern recognition and logical thinking essential for interviews and contests.

Stay consistent, keep coding, and don’t hesitate to revisit concepts if they seem tricky at first — recursion especially becomes easier the more you practice!
